          <h3>A little bit about us from the scout website</h3>
          <p>
            With the support, direction and guidance of Unit leaders, Explorer Scouts are encouraged to lead themselves, design their own programme and work towards the top awards that Scouting offers. 
            With exciting prospects like being a part of camps and expeditions both home and abroad; adventurous activities such as mountaineering, parascending and off shore sailing; Explorers offers fun and adventure for all. 
            Explorers also have the opportunity to be a part of The Explorer Scout Young Leadersâ€™ Scheme which develops their leadership skills and sense of responsibility, by helping to run meetings for younger sections.
